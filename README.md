# Prodios Labs Assignment: Simple Code Editor in React

## Overview

**This project aims to create a simple code editor in React, similar to react-simple-code-editor, utilizing the following technologies:**
<ul>
  <li>Prism JS: A syntax highlighting library.</li>
  <li>Prism JS: A vanilla JavaScript library for syntax highlighting.</li>
  <li>prism-react-renderer: A React implementation of Prism JS.</li>
  <li>Textarea HTML Element: The foundation for user input and editing.</li>

</ul>

## Features
<ul>
  <li>Syntax Highlighting: Utilizes Prism JS to dynamically highlight syntax as the user types.</li>
  <li>Simple and Responsive: Provides a straightforward user interface resembling a typical code editor.</li>
  <li>Easy Integration: Can be easily integrated into React applications for enhanced code editing experiences.</li>
</ul>

## Implementation Details
**To achieve a functional code editor, the project combines a textarea HTML element with Prism JS for syntax highlighting. The following steps were taken:**

### Setting Up Prism JS:

Imported and configured Prism JS in the React application.
Leveraged prism-react-renderer to integrate Prism JS with React components.
Component Structure:

Created a CodeEditor component responsible for rendering the textarea and handling user input.
Utilized state management (e.g., useState hook) to manage the content of the textarea.
Syntax Highlighting:

Integrated Prism JS to dynamically highlight syntax based on the content typed by the user.
Configured Prism to support various programming languages and themes.
Styling:

Applied basic CSS to enhance the appearance and usability of the code editor.
Ensured responsive design for different screen sizes.
